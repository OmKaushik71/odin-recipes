    <h2>ORIGIN OF SICILIAN CAPONATA RECIPE</h2>
    <p>The Caponata recipe is probably the most classic Sicilian appetizer, and one of the most worldwide famous Italian recipes.

        The origin of Caponata is uncertain, but the first written sources date back to 1709. </p>
        <p>The Etimologicum Siculum describes this dish as "Acetarium et variis rebus minutium conficis" (transl. "Salad and a variety of minced things").

            At that time, the Caponata had frequently been paired with grilled Mahi Mahi and served during the noble's feasts.</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>4 tbsp olive oil</li>
                <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
                <li>4 garlic cloves, finely sliced</li>
                <li>250g chargrilled Mediterranean veg</li>
                <li>400g can chopped tomatoes</li>
                <li>1 tbsp small capers</li>
                <li>2 tbsp raisins</li>
                <li>350g rigatoni, penne or another short pasta shape</li>
                <li>bunch basil leaves, picked</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat the oil in a large pan and cook the onion for 8-10 mins until starting to caramelise (or for longer if you have time â€“ the sweeter the better). Add the garlic for the final 2 mins of cooking time.</li>
                <li>Tip in the mixed veg, tomatoes, capers and raisins. Season well and simmer, uncovered, for 10 mins, or until you have a rich sauce.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, boil the kettle. Pour the kettleful of water into a large pan with a little salt and bring back to the boil. Add the pasta and cook until tender with a little bite, then drain, reserving some of the pasta water. Tip the pasta into the sauce, adding a splash of pasta water if it needs loosening. Scatter with the basil leaves and parmesan, if you like, and serve straight from the pan.</li>
            </ol>
