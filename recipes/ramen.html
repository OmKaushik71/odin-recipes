        this vegan ramen for a tasty midweek meal in just 25 minutes. Dried
        mushrooms and miso paste give the broth plenty of umami flavour</em

    <h2>First: What, Exactly, Is Ramen?</h2>
    <p>
      Ramen noodles are made from wheat flour and oil, usually with a few extra
      ingredients for flavor, such as salt, or additional fillers such as potato
      starch - and that's it! All these ingredients are 100% vegetarian, and
      even 100% vegan!
    </p>
    <p>
      Health food stores may carry vegetarian ramen noodle brands, though they
      aren't as cheap as you might expect, and if the main reason you eat ramen
      is that it's cheap, well, there’s no reason to purchase ramen if it's not
      budget-friendly! If it's convenience you’re after, then look for Soken
      brand vegetarian ramen (with such awesome flavors as "Spicy Dragon",
      "Bengal Curry" and Wasabi) or Dr. Mc Dougall's ramen noodle soup cups.
      These brands are clearly labeled as vegetarian or vegan, so there's no
      real need to read the ingredients list. And finally, though the package
      says "Vegetable" instead of "vegetarian", Koyo brand vegetable ramens are
      indeed vegetarian and vegan. If you can't find them locally, they're
      available pretty cheap on Amazon.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>thumb-sized piece ginger, sliced, plus a few slices cut into fine matchsticks to serve (optional)</li>
        <li>1½ tbsp white miso paste</li>
        <li>1 tbsp neri goma (white sesame paste) or tahin</li>
       <li>15g dried shiitake mushrooms</li> 
       <li>1l good-quality vegan stock</li>
       <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
       <li>200g firm tofu, cut into chunky cubes</li>
       <li>1 tbsp cornflour</li>
       <li>1 tbsp veg or sunflower oil</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Crush the garlic with the back of a big knife, then put it in a saucepan with the ginger, miso, neri goma, mushrooms, stock and soy. Bring to a gentle simmer, cover and bubble for 5 mins until the ginger is soft. Strain into a clean pan and discard everything left in the strainer.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, cook the tofu. Toss it in the cornflour and heat the oil in a frying pan. Fry for a few mins on each side, being careful as you turn it that it doesn’t fall apart. Cook the noodles for 1 min less than pack instructions, so they retain a little bite. Drain and leave in the pan with a little cooking water so they don’t stick together.</li>
        <li>Add the pak choi and whites of the spring onions to the broth and gently reheat for 1-2 mins until the greens have just wilted.</li>
        <li>Divide the noodles between two deep bowls, ladle over the broth and veg. Top with the tofu, beansprouts, carrot and ginger matchsticks, green parts of the spring onions and a drizzle of sesame oil, plus the other toppings, if you like.</li>
    </ol>
