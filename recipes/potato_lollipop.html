    <h2>Potato Lollipop For Kids</h2>
    <p>If you are looking for tiffin box recipes for your kid, then this potato lollipop is such a quick recipe. You can prepare the mixture overnight and refrigerate it. You may shape them differently to make them attractive for kids. Use a cookie cutter to shape them. Make a star or shallow fry like a patty</p>
    <p>Even these are the best easy finger foods for toddlers. Remove chili when making for kids or toddlers. Yes, this is not an everyday tiffin box recipe for kids but of course, you can add grated paneer, or mashed veggies to add nutritional benefits to kids.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Potatoes</li>
        <li>Corn starch</li>
        <li>Refined flour</li>
        <li>Bread Crumbs</li>
        <li>Spices</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>This is very simple to make the lollipops. Take mashed potatoes. Add in all spices, cheese, bread crumbs (regular). Mix well making a soft dough like structure.</li>
        <li>Divide the whole mixture into equal sized balls. Refrigerate for sometime (optional if you are using cooled potatoes). This will help in setting the shape of the mixture.</li>
        <li>In the meanwhile prepare a slurry of flour and cornstarch. Keep the panko bread crumbs ready in another plate/ bowl for coating. In this stage, you can keep the potato balls in a freezer-friendly pouch or container and freeze for up to 2 - 3 weeks. Whenever required, remove from the freezer and keep at room temperature for 5 minutes and follow the rest of the steps.</li>
        <li>Now take out the prepared balls and dip into the slurry first. Then take out from the slurry and roll it on the bread crumbs nicely.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep frying pan. Drop the prepared potato balls one by one gently. Don't overcrowd the pan. Make in batches of 8 - 10 maximum at a time. Fry till you see it's golden and looks crunchy.</li>
        <li>Your potato balls are ready. To give it a shape of lollipop, serve it with a lollipop stick or a regular stick that makes it a lollipop. Many people add the stick while frying and fry along with the stick. But I don't do that way.</li>
        <li>Serve your potato balls or potato lollipop with any sauce of your choice. A simple tomato or chili sauce also goes good.</li>
